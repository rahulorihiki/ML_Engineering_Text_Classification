# Text Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building and deploying a machine learning model for text classification. The goal is to classify text data into predefined categories using various machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Saved models and related files.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for running the model and other utilities.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd text-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the `data/` directory.
2. **Training**: Run the training script to train the model.
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using the test dataset.
    ```bash
    python src/evaluate.py
    ```
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to classify new text data.
    ```bash
    python src/predict.py --input <input_text>
    ```
